### Hi there! I'm Hitansh Shah, and I love puzzles.

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Quantitative Finance** enthusiast. With 8+ years of programming experience and a strong foundation in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Software Development**, I love solving problems and building stuff with code—especially those involving quant finance, markets, and statistics (and Counter-Strike).
