### Hi there! I'm Hitansh Shah, and I love puzzles.

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Quantitative Finance** enthusiast. With 8+ years of programming experience and a strong foundation in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Software Development**, I like solving problems and building things with code, especially around quant finance, markets, statistics, and Counter-Strike.

### Background

* MS Statistics (Computational Finance) @ Purdue University, West Lafayette (Class of 2025)
* BSc. Data Science and Programming @ IIT-Madras
* BTech Computer Engineering @ NMIMS MPSTME, Mumbai
* Oracle Certified Professional Java Developer

---

### Current Focus

* Integrating my interest in markets, modeling, and programming into practical quantitative finance research.
* Building a live pricing + execution stack for **Counter-Strike 2 prediction markets**, including:

  * Bayesian multinomial logistic regression for round-level win probabilities
  * Variational inference with map-specific priors
  * Entropy-weighted prior blending to stay calibrated under uncertainty
  * Monte-Carlo Best-of-3 series simulation to translate round forecasts into contract fair values
  * Market-making logic (fair value, spread, inventory-aware skew) with exchange execution + position tracking (Kalshi/Polymarket-style venues)
* Exploring systematic trading, portfolio construction, and predictive modeling across traditional and digital markets.

### Featured Projects

#### Bayesian Oracle for E-Sports Prediction Markets (CS2) - Current

A probabilistic pricing + execution system for CS2 contracts on Kalshi/Polymarket-style exchanges.

* Live state ingestion (match/round context) → posterior updates → fair-value output
* Bayesian softmax / multinomial logit in Pyro for round win probability surfaces
* Map priors (Beta) + uncertainty-aware blending to keep probabilities coherent
* Monte-Carlo Best-of-3 engine to price series outcomes and compute EV under different lines
* Automated quoting + order management with inventory/risk controls and exchange position reconciliation
  Repo: coming soon / private until publication

#### Self-Calibrating Air Quality Sensor Network — IIT Bombay

Developed a low-cost sensor (LCS) network for high-resolution air quality monitoring.

* Self-diagnosing + self-calibrating ML pipelines
* Real-world deployment and environmental impact

#### CS:GO TradeUp Finder

Used Genetic Algorithms to identify profitable tradeups on the Steam Community Market.

* Achieved ~20% expected gain per tradeup
* Combined market scraping, optimization, and Monte-Carlo EV estimation

#### DivStripper+

Scraped NSE India data to identify high-yield, dividend-rich stocks.

* Performed ex-dividend modeling to isolate high-value stripping opportunities
* Achieved up to ~3% post-tax returns

#### Heatwave & AQI Forecasting

Time-series environmental modeling using LSTMs and GRUs.

* Predicted temperatures with <2°C mean error
* Integrated satellite + meteorological data sources

#### Portfolio Management & Quant Tools

Built an internal PyPortfolioOpt extension library.

* Implemented Black-Litterman flows
* Automated risk estimation, posterior shrinkage, and portfolio construction
